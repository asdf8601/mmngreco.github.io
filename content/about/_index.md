Welcome to my blog! My name is Maximiliano Greco, and I'm excited to share my
experiences and learnings with you. This blog is a space for me to document my
journey through life, technology, and everything in between.

Growing up in Argentina, I always had an interest in technology and computers.
However, when I expressed my desire to study computer science, everyone
discouraged me from pursuing it. So, I decided to take matters into my own
hands and teach myself programming. I started with Python, and I quickly fell
in love with its simplicity and versatility.

After moving to Spain and completing my degree in Economics at the University
of Zaragoza, I continued to explore my passion for programming. I used Python
to analyze data and gain insights into the world of public economics. My love
for programming only grew stronger as I built my own mechanical keyboards and
explored the world of electronics.

Through this blog, I hope to share my knowledge and experiences with others who
are interested in programming, economics, or just learning new things. I
believe in the power of community and collaboration, and I'm excited to connect
with like-minded individuals.

So, whether you're a seasoned programmer or just starting out, join me on this
journey of learning, growth, and exploration. I'll be posting content in both
English and Spanish, and I look forward to hearing your thoughts and ideas.

Until next time, may your code be bug-free and your keyboard clicky!
