Welcome to my blog, where I will be sharing my experiences and learnings in the
world of programming and economics. My name is Maximiliano Greco, and I am an
Argentine who moved to Italy at the age of 15 before eventually settling in
Spain. While I struggled with my studies in Spain, I managed to graduate from
both high school and university.

I studied economics at the University of Zaragoza, mainly because I wanted to
understand better what was happening during the 2008 financial crisis. Despite
my interest in computer science, I was discouraged from studying it by those
around me, so I taught myself. I started with Python, completing all the
exercises I could find from my economics courses (econometrics, microeconomics,
and statistics).

My favorite subject in university was Public Economics because of its practical
component and the availability of data. It was a stimulating mix of theory and
practice, and for my final project, I analyzed inequality by examining the IRPF
tax using Python. I realized that there was a need for a package that could
help other economists analyze inequality, and so IneqPy was born.

Aside from programming, I am also an avid electronics enthusiast, and I enjoy
building mechanical keyboards like Corne, Lily58, and Dactyl Manuform. I love
learning new things, and I make sure to set aside time for activities like
running, yoga, and meditation, as well as reading.

My latest read was "The Pragmatic Programmer," a book that resonated with my
efficiency obsession. As a Vim user (proudly wearing my Vim t-shirt), I am
constantly looking for ways to streamline my workflow. My keyboards use Cherry
Brown switches, which provide the perfect balance of tactile feedback and quiet
operation.

My goal with this blog is to share what I have learned and to help others on
their programming journeys. While the majority of my content will be in
English, I will also be posting in Spanish. So, whether you're a Vim enthusiast
or just looking to learn more about programming, I hope you'll find something
of value here.

And as I like to say: "May the source be with you!" ðŸ¤“

--Max, your friendly neighborhood programmer.
