Today, let's chat about something that has both delighted and frustrated me in
equal measure: managing Python environments. You know how it is‚Äîsometimes you
feel on top of the world, and other times, you want to launch your computer out
the window.

## The PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV Trick!

So, here's the deal: setting `PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV` prevents you from
accidently polluting your global Python environment when installing packages.
It's like having an overprotective parent guard your environment from bad
influences. Nice, right?

Read this nice [SO question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17354852/how-to-make-sure-you-call-pip-only-in-virtualenv?rq=3).

But, here's the hiccup: It‚Äôs not compatible with `conda`. And guess what I was
using? Yep, `conda`. Ugh! So I jumped on the `venv` bandwagon, setting up
Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 environments. And It works like a charm.

Check out more about it here: [PIP Issue 7902](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/7902).


## Hello, Rye!

Then, I stumbled upon `rye`. It sounded perfect, a shiny new toy to replace
`conda` as my virtualenv and Python version manager. I was like, ‚Äúwhere have
you been all my life?‚Äù

However‚Ä¶ and there‚Äôs always a ‚Äúhowever‚Äù‚Ä¶ üòÖ I hit a few bumps, like frustrating
`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'setuptools'`. I mean, come on!

I‚Äôm still giving it a shot and testing it out. It‚Äôs got potential, but you
know, new tools always come with a learning curve and their own set of quirks.

For those curious, here's the rye bug tracker keeping my sanity in check:
