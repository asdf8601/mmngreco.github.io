## The Salt System How Salt Affects Our Health and Performance

- Salt is often associated with blood pressure, but it also regulates our appetite for salt and sugar cravings.
- The so-called salt system regulates many aspects of our health and performance, including athletic and cognitive performance, aging, and dementia.
- More salt might help some people, while less salt is better for others, depending on various parameters.
- Guidelines, in concert with a physician, can help arrive at a salt intake that optimizes mental and physical health and performance.
- The gut can distinguish between sweet things that contain calories and those that do, and the downstream consequences of this sensing are not yet clear.
- Artificial sweeteners are controversial, and while they can help avoid excessive caloric intake, they can also disrupt the gut microbiome and evoke an insulin response under certain conditions.
- Understanding how sweeteners are consumed at the level of the gut and how that changes brain function is crucial.

## The Importance of Salt and its Regulation in the Body

- Stevia is a plant-based noncaloric sweetener that many people consume, including the author.
- Artificial sweeteners are used by many people to keep their caloric intake in check, but their effects on cravings are still unclear.
- The Bohorquez Lab is a premier laboratory studying how foods consumed in the gut modify our nervous system and the foods we crave.
- The podcast is separate from the authors teaching and research roles at Stanford and aims to provide free science-related information to the public.
- Athletic Greens and LMNT are sponsors of the podcast, providing vitamin and mineral supplements and electrolyte drinks, respectively.
- InsideTracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from blood and DNA to provide specific recommendations for lifestyle changes.
- Salt regulates fluid balance, salt appetite, and appetite for other nutrients like sugar and carbohydrates.
- Small sets of neurons in the brain sense the levels of salt in the body and lack biological fences that other brain areas have.
- The blood-brain barrier is a particular fence that prevents most substances from accessing the brain.
- The brain regions that sense salt levels are special because they lack the blood-brain barrier.
- The kidneys play a crucial role in regulating salt levels in the body.
- The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is a hormonal system that regulates blood pressure and salt balance.
- The body has a complex system for regulating salt intake and excretion, but it can be disrupted by certain conditions or medications.

## The Blood-Brain Barrier and the Organum Vasculosum of the Lateral Terminalis (OVLT)

- Humans do not have much neuron turnover, meaning the neurons we are born with are the ones we use for most of our lives.
- The brain has a blood-brain barrier (BBB) to protect it from mutagens and other harmful substances.
- The OVLT is a circumventricular organ in the brain that can detect changes in the bloodstream and cerebrospinal fluid.
- The OVLT is important for regulating salt balance in the body.
- There are two types of thirst: osmotic thirst (related to salt concentration) and hypovolemic thirst (related to blood volume).
- Neurons in the OVLT detect changes in osmolarity and activate other brain areas to release hormones like vasopressin, which can restrict or increase urine secretion.

## Understanding Thirst and Fluid Balance in the Body

- There are two main types of thirst: osmotic thirst and hypovolemic thirst.
- Osmotic thirst is caused by high salt concentration in the blood, while hypovolemic thirst is caused by a drop in blood pressure.
- The OVLT detects changes in osmolarity and communicates with the supraoptic nucleus to release or shut off the release of vasopressin, which affects urine flow.
- Both types of thirst are not just about seeking water, but also about seeking salt to retain water.
- Sodium and water work together to generate thirst and regulate fluid balance in the body.
- The kidney is responsible for retaining or releasing various substances from the body, including salt and water.
- Hormonal signals, such as vasopressin, affect the kidneys function in retaining or releasing water.
- The concentration of salt relative to the amount of fluid in the blood is detected by the OVLT, which communicates with the pituitary to release hormones that act on the kidney to hold onto or let go of fluid.

## The Nuances of Vasopressin and Salt Intake

- Vasopressin is a hormone involved in antidiuresis, preventing urination, and also in aspects of sexual behavior and mating.
- Vasopressin and oxytocin are available as nasal sprays that can impact hypothalamic functions, but caution is advised in recreational use.
- Antidiuretic hormone prevents the bladder from filling by increasing the permeability of tubes through the kidney, allowing fluid to go back into the bloodstream.
- Sodium is used by the kidney to conserve water, but there is no simple formula for salt and water balance as it depends on various factors.
- Estrogen levels fluctuate in the menstrual cycle and can cause water retention, but estrogen also acts as a diuretic, making the relationship between hormones and salt and fluid complicated.
- Knowing your blood pressure is crucial in determining salt and fluid intake.
- Overconsumption of salt is detrimental to brain health and function, but too low salt intake can also lead to negative consequences on brain health and longevity.

## The Relationship Between Salt Intake and Health Outcomes

- Key Points:
- High-salt diets are often coupled with other unhealthy elements of diet, making it difficult to study the effects of salt intake alone.
- There are not many well-controlled nutrition studies exploring the effects of low, moderate, and high-salt conditions on health outcomes.
- Some studies suggest that a lower-salt diet can reduce the number of hazardous events, such as cardiovascular events and stroke.
- A U-shaped function shows that a high salt intake can be detrimental to health, but a moderate intake can reduce the number of hazardous events.
- The recommended cutoff for sodium intake is 2.3 grams per day, but some studies suggest that a higher intake may be beneficial for certain conditions, such as orthostatic disorders.
- Blood pressure is regulated by sodium intake and balance, and individuals with hypertension or prehypertension should be cautious about increasing their sodium intake.

## Context

- Orthostatic disorders refer to conditions where individuals have low blood pressure and may benefit from increasing their sodium intake.
- Blood pressure is regulated by sodium intake and balance due to the osmolarity of blood.

## Salt Intake and Health Recommendations and Considerations

- Blood pressure can be affected by sodium intake and low blood osmolarity, which can have downstream consequences.
- People with orthostatic disorders may need to increase their salt intake to combat symptoms.
- The American Society of Hypertension recommends 6,000 to 10,000 milligrams of salt per day for those with orthostatic disorders.
- Salt intake is homeostatically regulated, and cravings for salt may indicate a need for it.
- The Galpin equation suggests starting exercise hydrated with electrolytes and drinking your body weight in pounds divided by 30 ounces of fluid every 15 minutes.
- Most people are probably underhydrating and not getting enough electrolytes.

## The Importance of Salt and Water Balance

- Hormone systems and neural signals regulate salt and water balance, but they are slow to kick in.
- Salt can affect fluid intake, and the body can adapt to certain levels of salt intake over time.
- The body regulates salt and water balance by retaining or releasing water, not just by excreting sodium.
- Salt was a valuable commodity throughout human history and has direct impacts on thyroid function.
- Sea salt can contain other minerals that are beneficial to health.
- Too little salt can cause problems with the nervous system, and the adrenal glands play a role in salt preference.
- The stress system and salt craving system are directly related.

## The Relationship Between Sodium, Stress, and Anxiety

- Low dietary sodium can exacerbate anxiety in animal models and humans.
- The stress system is designed to deal with various challenges to the organism, and bringing sodium into the body would be one way to counteract or resist stressors.
- Adding salt is not always bad, and there is some wiggle room to explore whether more intake of sodium could actually be beneficial for suppressing some of the anxiety responses that people might feel under conditions of stress.
- Magnesium is important and there are many different forms of magnesium, and many people are not getting enough magnesium.
- Sodium and potassium work in close concert with one another, and the recommendations for ratios vary widely.
- The context of ones diet is important when considering sodium and potassium intake, and it all depends on the individuals context.

## The Importance of Salt and Fluid Balance

- During certain parts of the day, people who practice time-restricted feeding limit their calorie intake by not consuming food for certain periods of time.
- They consume fluids during these periods, including caffeine, which is a diuretic and causes the excretion of fluids from the body.
- It is important to replenish lost fluids and electrolytes, including sodium, by increasing water intake and adding a small amount of salt to the water.
- Dr. James DiNicolantonios book, The Salt Fix, provides recommendations for and electrolyte intake, including 3.2 to 4.8 grams of sodium per day and 4 grams of potassium.
- High salt intake can increase health risks, but low salt intake can also lead to negative health outcomes.
- Salt intake can affect sugar consumption and cravings, as the brain registers the presence of salt and can influence the desire for more salt or sugar.
- Parallel pathways in the taste system allow for the perception of salty and sweet tastes, and these pathways can influence each other.

## The Role of Sodium in Perception and Neuron Function

- Perception of color is based on the comparison of electrical activity of neurons that absorb different wavelengths of light.
- The taste system has parallel pathways for different tastes, and the interaction between them can affect food choices and sugar cravings.
- Salty-sweet combinations in foods can be diabolical in terms of inspiring people to eat more than they would otherwise.
- Sodium plays a crucial role in the way neurons function, specifically in the firing of electrical activity through the action potential.
- Neurons have an inside and an outside, and changing the electrical activity involves the movement of ions such as sodium and potassium.
- Increasing salt intake should be done in a clean context with relatively unprocessed foods to better hone in on specific salt needs and reduce sugar cravings.

## The Importance of Sodium in Neuron Communication and Nervous System Function

- Sodium carries a positive charge and is crucial for neuron communication through action potentials.
- Neurons go from negative to positive charge when stimulated by another neuron, and sodium rushes into the cell.
- Sodium is also important for restoring the charge of neurons by being pushed back out of the cell.
- Sufficient levels of salt in the body are necessary for the brain and nervous system to function properly.
- Drinking too much water without sufficient electrolytes, including sodium, can disrupt the balance of sodium and potassium and lead to confusion, dizziness, and lack of coordination.
- Salt intake should be considered in the context of fluid intake, diet, caffeine intake, and electrolyte balance.
- Increasing salt intake may be beneficial for some individuals under certain conditions, such as low blood pressure or postural syndromes.
- The combination of salty and sweet tastes can bias individuals towards craving more processed foods.
- The book The Salt Fix offers interesting insights into the history and applications of salt in health and performance metrics.

## The Importance of Sodium Balance Key Points

- There is no tool or device that can monitor our sodium intake and provide a precise amount we should take in each day.
- We must figure out the appropriate amount of sodium intake for ourselves, taking into consideration contextual factors.
- Strict recommendations for salt intake cannot be made universally across the board for everybody.
- Salt is not an evil substance; our physiology, cognition, mental and physical health, and performance are dependent on it.
- Our brain and bodily organs interact to help us regulate sodium balance, and we have neurons in our brain that are tuned to the of salt in our body.
- Thorne supplements are of the highest quality and can enhance sleep and focus.
