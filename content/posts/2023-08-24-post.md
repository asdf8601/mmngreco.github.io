## Context

I've recently discovered an impressive CLI tool called [ChatGPT][chatgpt],
which has replaced about 80% of my browser interactions. Now, I want to share
how to create a custom keybinding in i3 to open ChatGPT with a simple `Win+g`
command.

## Setting Up the Keybinding

To create this keybinding, you need to add the following lines to your
`i3/config` file:

```
bindsym $mod+g exec st -T "st:ChatGPT" -f "Caskaydia Cove Nerd Font:pixelsize=14" -e chatgpt
for_window [title="st:ChatGPT"] floating enable, resize set 600 px 600 px, move position center
```

After adding these lines, restart i3. Now, you can press `Win+g` to open your
ChatGPT CLI, ready for use.
